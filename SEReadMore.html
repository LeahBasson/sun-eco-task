	<p> <span style = "font-size:34px; font-weight:bold;"> “athens and the greek isles” </span> <br> Reviewed November 20, 2010 <br><br> We had absolutely no problems traveling 
	to Greece this past September. No riots like the media kept warning of. The Greek people were so friendly , helpful and hospitable. The trip itinerary to Athens 
	(5 days), Santorini (3 days)and Mykonos (3 days) was perfect to get an overall feel for Greece and with the perfect amount of spent time on each 
	island. I would highly recommend Gate One travel to anyone thinking of traveling to Greece.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The hotels are wonderful, clean and in the best locations.... even the so-callled budget level that we use. The preplanned transfers made the trip very smooth. 
	We were able to get to Greece on a whim when I saw the fantastic price and couldn't pass it up. Make sure you do some reading before going to be able to appreciate
	all the history, mythology and architecture that you will encounter.

	<p> <span style = "font-size:34px; font-weight:bold;"> “Minos Magic - Greece trip” </span> <br> Reviewed October 23, 2010 <br><br> My husband and I have never been to
	Greece but we wanted to see a lot in 16 days. We researched a lot and found that AirTransat had put together a very good itineary to see the main parts of Greece and 
	islands. The Minos Magic Package has two options, Option 1 is the regular package and Option 2 is the upgraded version. We chose to upgrade to Option 2. My husband 
	and I are in our 30's and we really didnt want to be part of a "tour", so Minos Magic was perfect.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	First off, our flight: We flew with Airtransat and upgraded to Option Plus (first time ever upgrading for flights). This was totally worth it, especially for long 
	trips. We didnt have very big seats, but we were able to pre-reserve our seats so we knew we were able to sit together.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	From the moment we arrived in Athens, an Air Transat rep was already there waiting to greet us. She quickly escorted us to our bus and from there on,
	everything went very smoothly. These reps would give us tips on the places we stayed and help us get to our hotel. Sometimes it would be a bus transporting us,
	or sometimes it was a taxi. (Somtimes the taxis are awesome because some drive Mercedes and they go real fast. So its much more comfortable than the coach buses).
	Also something worth mentioning, is that the Air Transat reps do not try to push the excursions on you.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The cruise ship: This was our first time on any cruise and I must say, there is nothing to rave about the Louise Cruise lines. If your expecting anything special,
	don't. The food was horrible and they charge $30/day for all you can drink alcohol and $15/day for pop. Good thing my husband and I ate on the islands every time 
	we docked. We did opted out of the $30/day drinks. We were quite content with water at every meal (which is free). However, having said that, the staff were very 
	nice and always friendly.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Upgrading to Option 2: This was definitely the best way to go. We stayed at all the upgraded hotels and they were very nice and clean. However, we did encounter
	a small problem at Terra Maris (in Crete). Our room had a connecting door with the room beside us, and our door could not lock with our room key. We requested 
	with the front desk to have it locked but they told us there was a problem with the lock and that we did not need to worry because there was no one on the other 
	side. By the end of our trip, the connecting room did get occupied and we had to ask again to have the door locked. This time, they did it in an instant.
	(So much for having a problem with the lock! We think they were just too lazy to that done in the first place - But thats just our opinion.) On our last day in 
	Santorini our transport bus had to swing by several hotels and we did come across one of the hotels from Option 1 and it definitely did not look as nice as our 
	hotel from the outside.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Overall experience: Fantastic. Upgrading is the way to go. I would recommend Minos Magic to anyone who's looking to see the islands of Greece without a tour. 
	Our only regret is that we wished we had more time to have gone to the main parts of Greece and not just the islands.

	<p> <span style = "font-size:34px; font-weight:bold;"> “Our first European vacation - GREECE” </span> <br> Reviewed October 16, 2010 <br><br>After an
	uneventful flight from Omaha to Newark to Athens, we arrived at the airport and met our guide, Nick. We boarded a bus and Nick immediately began educating
	us on the current Greek culture, government, economy, and city of Athens.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	We stayed at Titiana Hotel in Athens. Although a little slow on check in, we were soon settled into our room and ready to hit the streets for a walk.
	The room was acceptable. Nothing fancy, but clean and all we needed.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	We walked to the National Gardens first, after passing the Parliment building. The gardens were nice and there were a few statues and a little history. 
	Nothing was in English, so I don't know if there was anything significant :)
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Next we walked to the Plaka and explored the busy streets of stores and cafes. While we were there, we ventured a little far and ended up in Ancient 
	Roman Agora. Neat place. We did not pay to go in, just walked the perimeter to see the ruins. Then back into Plaka and found a little restaurant for 
	a meal. The place was Efahris (spelled differently in Greek, obviously). We sat up in the loft area. We weren't worried about eating in a timely manner, 
	so the slow service was not an issue at all. The souvlaki, tzaziki, and bread were all excellent. The bread was the best we ate the entire trip.
	In fact, it was our best meal of the trip!
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Day 2 was a tour of Athens by bus. We stopped at Olympic Stadium, Temple of Zeus/Hadrian's Arch, the Acropolis, and Acropolis Museum. 
	Each was worth seeing and we definitely needed more time at the museum. I am not as much a museum person, but this one was excellent and 
	worth spending much time in.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Dinner was at a taverna in the Plaka. We had every appetizer, lots of bread, and souvlaki again. It was all very good and there was music and dancers for entertainment.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The next day was a ferry trip to Mykonos. We stayed at Petasos Beach Resort, which is very modern, clean, and fresh. The room was beautiful with
	a balcony overlooking the beach and sea. We walked to a market and purchased some wine and beer, left them in the hotel room and headed to the 
	beach. Dinner was at Niko's, just up the hill from the hotel. They had fresh caught fish as well as traditional Greek offerings. Another long, 
	slow, wonderful meal. We had sea bass, which was perfect.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Very wonderful vacation, excellent hotels, amazing food, the best tour guide ever, and just a great experience!!!
